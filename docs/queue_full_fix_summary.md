# Queue Full Detection Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The check failed because we used an unsupported check type in the `check_element` action.

### Original Configuration (Failed)
```json
{
  "type": "check_element",
  "selector": "span:has-text('You\\'ve reached your')",
  "value": {
    "check": "exists",
    "value": true
  }
}
```

### Why It Failed
- The automation engine doesn't support `"exists"` as a check type
- Supported check types are: `equals`, `not_equals`, `greater`, `less`, `contains`, `not_zero`
- The engine was comparing the element's text content against the boolean value `true`

### Log Evidence
```
Check element: text='You've reached your video submission limit. Please wait for current tasks to complete.' exists 'True' => False
```

## Solution

### Fixed Configuration
```json
{
  "type": "check_element",
  "selector": "span:has-text('You\\'ve reached your')",
  "value": {
    "check": "contains",
    "value": "You've reached your",
    "attribute": "text"
  }
}
```

### Why This Works
- Uses the `contains` check type to verify the element contains the expected text
- Explicitly specifies `attribute: "text"` to check the text content
- When the popup appears, the check passes and triggers the error handling logic

## Complete Implementation

### Flow Logic
1. **Submit Button Click** → Submit task creation
2. **Wait** → Allow time for popup to appear
3. **Check Element** → Look for queue full popup
4. **IF Check Passes** → Popup detected:
   - Log ERROR message
   - Force automation failure
   - Break out of execution
5. **IF Check Fails** → No popup:
   - Increment task counter
   - Continue normally

### Scheduler Integration
- When automation fails due to queue full, scheduler automatically:
  - Waits `failure_wait_time` seconds (default: 60)
  - Retries the configuration up to `max_retries` times (default: 3)
  - Moves to next configuration if all retries fail

## Testing Results

✅ All submit buttons now have proper queue full detection
✅ Conditional logic correctly handles popup presence/absence
✅ Error logging provides clear failure information
✅ Automation failure triggers scheduler retry mechanism

## Key Learnings

1. **Always validate action types** - Not all intuitive action parameters are supported
2. **Use contains for text checking** - More reliable than exists for popup detection  
3. **Test thoroughly** - Multiple submit buttons need consistent implementation
4. **Leverage existing scheduler logic** - No need to modify retry mechanisms

The queue full detection now works correctly and will prevent wasted automation attempts when the queue is at capacity.
