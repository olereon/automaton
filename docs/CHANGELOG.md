## Migration Notes

### While Loop Migration
If upgrading existing automations to use while loops:
1. Add variable initialization before loops
2. Replace manual retry logic with while loops
3. Add proper break conditions
4. Update element detection to use correct attributes
5. Add comprehensive logging for debugging

### Configuration Updates
- Update timeout values if using old default (30000ms ‚Üí 10000ms)
- Check element attribute usage (`text` vs `value`)
- Add variable substitution where beneficial
- Consider adding conditional logic for error handling
