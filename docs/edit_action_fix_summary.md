# Edit Action Window Fix Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed the Edit Action window in the GUI to ensure all automation action types have the correct input fields matching their Add Action window counterparts.

## Problems Identified

### Missing Action Types
The following action types were not properly handled in the `_create_action_fields` method:
- EXPAND_DIALOG
- CHECK_QUEUE  
- DOWNLOAD_FILE
- REFRESH_PAGE
- SWITCH_PANEL
- TOGGLE_SETTING
- STOP_AUTOMATION

### Incorrect Timeout Field Assignment
- STOP_AUTOMATION and REFRESH_PAGE were incorrectly receiving timeout fields

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `_create_action_fields` Method
Added handling for all missing action types:
- **TOGGLE_SETTING**: Added selector field and enable checkbox
- **EXPAND_DIALOG**: Added selector field
- **CHECK_QUEUE**: Added selector and expected status fields
- **DOWNLOAD_FILE**: Added selector field
- **SWITCH_PANEL**: Added panel selector field
- **REFRESH_PAGE & STOP_AUTOMATION**: Added as no-config-needed actions

### 2. Updated `_collect_action_data` Method
Added data collection logic for all new action types to properly gather field values when saving edited actions.

### 3. Fixed Timeout Field Logic
Excluded REFRESH_PAGE and STOP_AUTOMATION from receiving timeout fields, as they don't require them.

## Test Results
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_edit_action_fields.py`) that verifies:
- All 27 action types have correct fields in Edit dialog
- Data collection works properly for all action types
- No missing or unexpected fields

**Final Test Results: 27/27 PASSED âœ“**
