# Automaton Project Overview

## Introduction

Automaton is a powerful, lightweight web automation framework designed to simplify browser automation tasks. Built with Python and Playwright, it provides both GUI and CLI interfaces for creating and running automation sequences with advanced flow control, queue management, and intelligent download handling.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its architecture, and key features to help you understand what Automaton can do and how it's structured.

## Project Purpose

Automaton was created to address the need for a flexible, reliable web automation framework that:

- Simplifies complex web interactions through an intuitive interface
- Provides both visual (GUI) and programmatic (CLI) access
- Handles real-world web scenarios like queues, dynamic content, and downloads
- Offers advanced control flow for complex automation scenarios
- Maintains reliability through robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Dual Interface**: Modern GUI with Tkinter or powerful CLI for automation
- **30+ Action Types**: Comprehensive set of web interaction actions
- **Flow Control**: Advanced IF/ELIF/ELSE and WHILE loop support
- **Queue Management**: Intelligent queue detection and capacity management
- **Variable System**: Dynamic variables with substitution support
- **Stop Functionality**: Graceful termination with controller integration
- **Download Automation**: Advanced file download with metadata tracking
- **Scheduler Support**: Datetime-based scheduling with timezone support

### Technical Features

- **Async Execution**: Fast and efficient browser automation
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Headless/Headed Mode**: Run with or without browser UI
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms and error handling
- **Browser Persistence**: Keep browser open for debugging
- **Security Features**: Credential management and input validation

## Architecture Overview

Automaton follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

#### 1. Automation Engine
The heart of Automaton, responsible for:
- Executing automation sequences
- Managing browser interactions
- Handling flow control (loops, conditionals)
- Error detection and recovery

#### 2. Controller System
Provides centralized control over automation execution:
- Start/stop/pause functionality
- State management
- Signal propagation between components

#### 3. Action System
Modular action framework supporting:
- Basic web interactions (click, type, wait)
- Advanced operations (downloads, queue management)
- Flow control (conditionals, loops)
- Custom action extensibility

#### 4. Interface Layer
User-facing components:
- **GUI**: Tkinter-based graphical interface
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for programmatic access
- **API**: Programmatic interface for integration

#### 5. Utility Modules
Supporting functionality:
- Download management
- Performance monitoring
- Credential management
- Element selection and visualization
