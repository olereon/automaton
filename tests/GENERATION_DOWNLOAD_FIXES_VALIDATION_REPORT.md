### Debug Log Analysis

The validation analyzed debug logs from actual demo execution:

```json
{
  "session_info": {
    "start_time": "2025-08-26T14:19:11.360047",
    "session_id": "20250826_141911",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_type": "THUMBNAIL_CLICK_SUCCESS",
      "data": {
        "selector": ".thumsItem",
        "attempt": 1,
        "state_validations": {
          "content_changed": true,
          "landmark_elements_visible": true
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "step_type": "METADATA_EXTRACTION",
      "data": {
        "extraction_method": "enhanced_landmark_strategy",
        "extracted_data": {
          "generation_date": "26 Aug 2025 14:16:51"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Validation

All fixes are properly configured in `generation_download_config.json`:

```json
{
  "landmark_extraction_enabled": true,
  "use_descriptive_naming": true,
  "unique_id": "landmarkTest",
  "creation_time_text": "Creation Time",
  "download_no_watermark_text": "Download without Watermark",
  "naming_format": "{media_type}_{creation_date}_{unique_id}"
}
```
