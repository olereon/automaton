# Automaton - Web Automation Framework

## ü§ñ Project Overview

Automaton is a comprehensive web automation framework built with Python and Playwright. It provides both GUI and CLI interfaces for creating, managing, and executing web automation workflows. The system supports advanced flow control, queue management, generation downloads, and extensive action types.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **Engine** (`src/core/engine.py`): Main automation engine with action execution
- **Controller** (`src/core/controller.py`): Automation state management and control signals
- **GUI Interface** (`src/interfaces/gui.py`): Tkinter-based graphical interface
- **CLI Interface** (`src/interfaces/cli.py`): Command-line automation runner
- **Download Manager** (`src/utils/download_manager.py`): File download handling
- **Generation Downloads** (`src/utils/generation_download_manager.py`): Specialized content downloads
